​Remember, to graduate you will have to maintain an average attendance of 60%​ or better. If your average attendance falls below 60%, you will have to go through remedial measures (which are normally harder to complete, especially if you are working outside of Fairfield).
 
Also, note that most faculty reward your high meditation attendance with extra points. You can earn up to 1.5 extra points (out of 100) if you maintain an attendance record of 90% or better (0.5 if you do 70% or better and 1.0 if you do 80% of better).
 
All the best!
